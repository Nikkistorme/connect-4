This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run the app in development mode run `npm start`.

This is a large project, so I've broken it down into steps:
* [x] Create initial UI of game board.
* [x] Player can "drop" tokens on the board
* [x] Have a "win checker" that determines if a player has achieved the glorious "four-in-a-row."
* [x] Use `redux` in the project for state management.
* [x] Update interface when a player has won the game
* [x] Have a button that resets the game board
* [ ] Player can create a game that can be accessed by other players accessing the site
* [ ] Player can join an already created game
* [ ] Player can play against other players in realtime
